    "### Brief 90-second Elevator Pitch\n",
    "- There is a great amount of scientific evidence and support that climate change has impacted the growing seasons of important food commodities \n",
    "- This in turn would impact the cost of these commodities\n",
    "- Many companies who depend on grown commodies for their product lines are aware of this issue but don't necessarily understand how this imact will trickle down into their sales.\n",
    "    - things will cost more to produce\n",
    "    - they may have to raise prices\n",
    "    - but will consumers and stock holders change their habits????\n",
    "- I woud like to try and understand if this climate change impact can be seen in the stock market\n",
    "\n",
    "- The goal of this project is to determine if a case can be made to support that climate change in some way impacts the stock market through analyzing the relationship between: \n",
    "    - climate factors\n",
    "        - temp\n",
    "        - precip\n",
    "    - comodity stock pricing\n",
    "        - CORN\n",
    "        - WEAT\n",
    "        - CANE\n",
    "    - and company stock pricing\n",

    "- look at companies to see if they ahve changed the size of their products insread of changing prices--responding to change in commodity pricing without changing the stock market. \n",
    "    \n",
    "### What you’re interested in\n",
    "- climate change \n",
    "- a lot of research on how cliamte chnage is effecting growing cyclces for many important commodity crops\n",
    "- NOT alot of research on how this can/ if it effects the stock market\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can climate chnage effect the stock market or will the desire for consumption allow stock to remain unchnaged\n",
    "- At what point will consumption cause a food security issue because crop output can no longer be as strong as it once was? ---this will ot necessarily be answered in this project but its an interesting point to consider\n",
