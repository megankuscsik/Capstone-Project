    "2. Compare daily and monthly results and label as \"same\" or \"different\"\n",

    "3. For those that are different, evaluate how different. Soem different can be changed to same \n",
    "4. For same results:\n",
    "    - evaluate results and score reults based on strength\n",
    "    - correlation: moderate and above = best\n",
    "    - covariance= negative\n",
