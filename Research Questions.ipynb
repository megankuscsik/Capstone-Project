    "    - paper investigates the empirical association between **stock market volatility** and investor mood-proxies related to the weather (cloudiness, temperature and precipitation) and the environment (nighttime length) \n",
    "    - results suggest that cloudiness and length of nighttime are inversely related to historical, implied and realized measures of volatility \n",
    "    - strength of association seems to vary with the location of an exchange on Earth with respect to the equator\n",

    "    - We find that the event information had an economically important and statistically significant impact on capital market returns\n",
    "    - Poorly rated firms suffered market penalties, but we find limited benefits for firms receiving good ratings \n",

    "    - found that natural calamities (changes to normal weather) have an impact on the growth of rice\n",

    "    - have rice reserves to help feed demands when poor growing seasons occur (try and control the price)\n",

    "    - focus on drought, the most damaging natural disaster for crops and food-company cash flows\n",
    "    - we show that prolonged drought spells in a country, as measured by a 3-year moving average of PDSI, forecast poor returns for a portfolio comprised of food stocks in that country (**creates volatility**)\n",
